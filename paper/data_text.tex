\subsection{\mgii\ absorption line systems}
We used data from the JHU-SDSS metal absorption line catalog published
by \citet{Zhu2013}. This catalog provides redshift, rest-frame
equivalent widths and velocity dispersion (among other quantities) of
XXX \mgii\ $\lambda\lambda 2796, 2803$ systems found in the spectra of
XXX \acp{qso} from the \ac{sdss} DR7 and DR9. The catalog also gives
the same information for the corresponding \mgi $\lambda 2853$ and
\feii $\lambda 2344$, $\lambda 2383$, $\lambda 2586$, and $\lambda
2600$. The catalog comes from a fully automatized algorithm briefly
described as follows:

(i) each QSO continuum is fitted by a set of 12 non-negative
eigen-spectra following the nonnegative matrix factorization technique
\citep[NMF;][]{Lee1999;Blanton2007}. A set of median filters are
applied to the residuals in order to get rid of the intermediate scales
(larger than the typical \mgii\ doublet separation) fluctuations.

(ii) 

and has a
high purity.

completeness level

The presence of these other transitions help to ensure a high
reliability for the \mgii systems.

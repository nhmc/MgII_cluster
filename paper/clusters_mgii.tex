\section{Introduction}
\acresetall
\ntcomment{brief introduction}

\section{Data}

\subsection{Galaxy clusters}
We use the \ac{redmapper} catalog \citep{Rykoff2014} ...
\ntcomment{\\
- Description of the \ac{redmapper} cluster catalog\\
- Explain why \ac{redmapper}: advantages\\
- Clusters centers as probabilities\\
- Cluster members as probabilities\\
- Cluster Richness corrected by incompleteness\\
- Photometric uncertainties are small\\
- Some spectroscopic redshift exists\\
- Adopted richness--mass relationship\\
- Explain completeness and purity\\}

\subsection{\mgii absorption line systems}
We use the \mgii\ catalog published by  ...

\ntcomment{\\
- Description of the \mgii\ catalog\\
- Explain why this catalog in particular: advantages\\
- Explain the main observables relevant for this study: z, EW, Vdisp? \\
- Explain why completeness level issues, and why these do not affect our analysis.}

\section{Data analysis and results}
\subsection{Cross-match between clusters and \mgii\ systems}
\ntcomment{\\
- Show plots of redshift overlap\\
- Explain subsample of the cluster catalog used in this analysis\\
- Explain subsample of the \mgii\ catalog used in this analysis\\
- Justify the maximum scale adopted (~40 Mpc? use as motivation the mean distance between clusters?)
- Define redshift path per cluster\\
- Define hits\\
}
\input{figs/fig1.tex}

\subsection{The incidence \mgii\ in clusters}
\ntcomment{\\
- Define incidence in clusters, $dN/dz$\\
- Define incidence as a function of co-moving separation\\
- Define incidence as a function of virial radii; emphasize why is important to scale by virial mass: massive clusters are larger. Dark matter haloes are expected to show self-similarity, others)\\
- Plot these two quantities for our full samples in both co-moving and r200 separations.\\
- Mention whether these two seem consistent with each other but leave interpretation to the Discussion section. If no qualitative differences, stick to r200.}

\input{figs/fig2.tex}

\subsection{The incidence \mgii\ in clusters as a function of cluster mass}
\ntcomment{\\
- Define cluster mass bins; explain why we chose these particular bins.\\
- Main result of the paper: incidence as a function of cluster masses\\
- Plot incidence as a function of cluster masses, in r200 (or both in case is worth it)}



\subsection{Physical model}
\ntcomment{\\ 
- Explain our model to fit the results\\ 
- Mention whether our model consistent with the known masses of the
clusters in each mass bin?  (either result will be very
interesting) but leave full interpretation to Discussion section\\ }

\input{figs/fig3.tex}

\section{Discussion}
\ntcomment{\\
- General implications of results, focusing on the main result\\
- Although we focused on the larger scales, we can speculate now on our reported results on scales < 1 Mpc (subject to large statistical uncertainties).\\ 
- Why is important to have cold gas in clusters\\
- Are the observed trends consistent with expectations?\\
}

\subsection{Comparison to previous work}
\ntcomment{\\
- Lopez+2008\\
- Zhu+14\\
- Gauthier+14\\
- etc. \\
- emphasize why our experiment is different (we focus on the most massive haloes in the universe and we know the masses of the clusters very well)\\
- focus on agreements and disagreements\\
}

\subsection{Future prospects [??]}
\ntcomment{\\
- What can be done to extend this work?\\
- Is it worth to aim for less massive groups? Is there evidence for a different behaviour in these lower mass haloes?\\
- Mention work on the smaller scales that we will do ?\\
- Address different galaxy populations (star-forming, non-star-forming)\\
- Split by \mgii\ EW for a fixed cluster mass\\
- Investigate properties of clusters showing and not showing \mgii.\\
- Put limits on the covering fraction of \mgii inside galaxy clusters [this seems important, should we address this in this paper rather than later? We could to it for the strongest absorbers without worrying much about incompleteness].\\

-Plot QSO properties as a function of cluster masses, and transverse
separation in the same way the analysis was presented.\\
